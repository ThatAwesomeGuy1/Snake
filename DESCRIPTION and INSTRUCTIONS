This is a snake game using random, pygame, and system. If you would like to play it you can put it in any coding software or even your computer and click run. Make sure that you import the three imports. Feel Free to reach out if you have any questions, comments, or help. I think this is a good template if you want to create your own snake game. Have fun!
